      The DistillerSR API documentation is designed for technical users to learn
      how various features in Distiller can be interacted with via the API for
      use with automated scripts, and leveraged in projects outside of
      DistillerSR. DistillerSR allows users to perform systematic reviews by
      importing references from various sources (like PubMed, EBSCO, etc.),
      reviewing references, and generating reports containing reviewer response
      sets, extracted data, and other statistics.
